Izuku Midoriya

Hero Name: Deku <br>
Quirk: One for All<br>
</p>
<p>
Before Izuku met All Might, he was a kid without a quirk, who would always dream about becoming a hero. He continued to make analysis over many heroes in hopes of being able to save others. However, in his meeting with All Might, All Might viewed Izuku as a suitable person to inherit his powers. After training to handle One for All, Izuku takes in All Might's powers and finds out that his body part shatters each time his newfound powers are used. Although he passes the entrance exams into the most famous school for heroes, UA, he needs to work on controlling his powers while also coming against the threats of the League of Villains.<br>
